# Fuzzy_RC_codes
Bhadra reservoir E-flow study using Fuzzy rule curves hedging technique

The Reservoir_simultaion_codes folder contains the following files:

The program ReserSim_stage-1.c, ReserSim_stage-2-IMEM-1.c and ReserSim_stage-2-IMEM-2.c. 
The reservoir simulation codes are given without the input data used for the study, as they are confidential, obtained from the Bhadra reservoir authorities during field visit. 
The reservoir_operation.h file that contains the reservoir operation rules
The subroutines of IHA indicators given as C++ header files (17 files) that are used for the computation of IHA statistics
Another header file, sort_ascend.h, that is used for sorting the flow data.
While compiling any ReserSim.c program, all the above files are to be kept in the same folder (21 files). 

The Principal_component_analysis folder consists of the PCA code written in Matlab and its input file.

The Outputs_FRC file has the outputs from Borg-MOEA corresponding to the results discussed in the manuscript.
